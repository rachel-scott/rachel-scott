- 👋 Hi, I’m @rachel-scott
- 👀 I’m interested in combining my Data Science and UX Research skills in a product management role.
- 👩‍⚕️ I believe in using tech for good and love exploring how it can improve people's lives
- 🌱 In my free time I enjoy baking, painting, and tending to my plants
- In addition to the projects here, I've experience in Python/C#/VBA from my co-op roles and C/Racket/HTML/CSS/assembly from my university computer science courses but unfortunately cannot share them here due to confidentiality.
