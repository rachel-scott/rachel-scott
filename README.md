- 👋 Hi, I’m @rachel-scott
- 👀 I’m interested in software development, UX/UI design, and product management
- 👩‍⚕️ I believe in using tech for good and love exploring how it can improve people's lives
- 🌱 In my free time I enjoy baking, painting, and tending to my plants
- In addition to the projects here, I've written multiple scripts in Python/C#/VBA for my co-op roles and Racket/C/HTML/CSS for my university computer science courses but unfortunately cannot share them here due to confidentiality.
